                    </p>
                    <strong>8) Emergancy Preparedness</strong>
                    <p>
                        <li>Familiarize yourself with basic first aid techniques for dogs, including how to stop bleeding, perform CPR, and treat common injuries.</li>
                        <li>Have a plan in place for emergencies, including the nearest veterinary hospital and contact information for animal control services.</li>
                    </p>
                    <strong>9) Respect Boundaries</strong>

                        <li>Respect the boundaries of other dog owners and their pets by maintaining a safe distance if requested.</li>
                        <li>If you encounter a stray or unfamiliar dog, avoid approaching them and contact local animal control for assistance.</li>
                    </p>
                    <strong>10) Continuous Learning</strong>
